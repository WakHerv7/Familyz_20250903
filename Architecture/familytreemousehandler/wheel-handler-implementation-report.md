# Family Tree Wheel Handler Implementation Report

## Overview

This report documents the successful implementation of the wheel handler solution for the SVG-based family tree visualization component (`FamilySvgTreeView.tsx`). The implementation follows the specifications outlined in `wheel-handler-implementation.md` and addresses the critical issue of wheel event interference with normal page scrolling.

## Problem Statement

Previously, wheel events on the family tree SVG were interfering with normal page scrolling behavior. The browser's default wheel behavior (page scrolling) needed to be disabled when interacting with the SVG family tree, but only when the mouse cursor was actually over the SVG element. This required precise event handling to isolate zoom functionality to the SVG area while preserving normal page navigation.

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Mouse Position Tracking

The existing mouse position tracking was leveraged and enhanced:

```typescript
const [mouseOverSvg, setMouseOverSvg] = useState(false);
```

**Location**: `family-tree-frontend/src/components/family-visualization/hooks/useZoomPan.ts`

### 2. SVG Event Handlers

Mouse enter/leave handlers were already implemented in the main component:

```jsx
onMouseEnter={() => {
  console.log("üê≠ MOUSE ENTER Family SVG");
  zoomPan.setMouseOverSvg(true);
}}
onMouseLeave={() => {
  console.log("üê≠ MOUSE LEAVE Family SVG");
  zoomPan.setMouseOverSvg(false);
}}
```

**Location**: `family-tree-frontend/src/components/family-visualization/FamilySvgTreeView.tsx`

### 3. Enhanced Wheel Handler with Mouse Position Check

Modified the `handleWheel` function to only process wheel events when the mouse is over the SVG:

```typescript
const handleWheel = useCallback(
  (event: React.WheelEvent) => {
    if (!mouseOverSvg) return; // Only handle wheel when mouse is over SVG

    event.preventDefault();
    event.stopPropagation();

    console.log("üîç Wheel event received by SVG - handling zoom");

    // ... zoom logic
  },
  [mouseOverSvg, zoomLevel, viewBox, baseViewBox, svgRef]
);
```

**Key Changes**:

- Added mouse position validation: `if (!mouseOverSvg) return`
- Added `event.preventDefault()` to prevent browser scroll
- Added `event.stopPropagation()` to prevent event bubbling
- Updated dependency array to include `mouseOverSvg`

**Location**: `family-tree-frontend/src/components/family-visualization/hooks/useZoomPan.ts`

### 4. Non-Passive Wheel Event Listener

Added a `useEffect` with a non-passive wheel event listener to guarantee `preventDefault()` works:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const svgEl = svgRef.current;
  if (!svgEl) return;

  const fn = (e: WheelEvent) => {
    if (mouseOverSvg) {
      e.preventDefault();
      handleWheel(e as any);
    }
  };

  svgEl.addEventListener("wheel", fn, { passive: false });
  return () => svgEl.removeEventListener("wheel", fn);
}, [mouseOverSvg, handleWheel, svgRef]);
```

**Key Features**:

- Uses `{ passive: false }` to ensure `preventDefault()` is effective
- Directly calls `handleWheel` when mouse is over SVG
- Properly cleans up event listener on unmount
- Depends on `mouseOverSvg` and `handleWheel` for reactivity

**Location**: `family-tree-frontend/src/components/family-visualization/hooks/useZoomPan.ts`

### 5. Touch Action Disable

The `touchAction: "none"` was already implemented in the TreeCanvas component:

```jsx
<svg
  style={{
    touchAction: "none", // Prevent touch scrolling on mobile
    // ... other styles
  }}
  // ... props
/>
```

**Location**: `family-tree-frontend/src/components/family-visualization/components/TreeCanvas.tsx`

### 6. Container-Level Event Handling Removal

Removed wheel event handling from the container div to prevent interference:

```jsx
// BEFORE: Container handled wheel events
<div
  onWheel={(e) => {
    e.stopPropagation();
    if (onWheel) onWheel(e as any);
  }}
>

// AFTER: Container lets wheel events pass through
<div
  style={{
    overscrollBehavior: "none",
  }}
>
```

**Location**: `family-tree-frontend/src/components/family-visualization/components/TreeCanvas.tsx`

### 7. Component Integration Updates

Removed the `onWheel` prop from TreeCanvas since wheel events are now handled directly by the non-passive listener:

```jsx
// BEFORE
<TreeCanvas
  onWheel={zoomPan.handleWheel}
  // ... other props
/>

// AFTER
<TreeCanvas
  // onWheel prop removed - handled by non-passive listener
  // ... other props
/>
```

**Location**: `family-tree-frontend/src/components/family-visualization/FamilySvgTreeView.tsx`

3. **`family-tree-frontend/src/components/family-visualization/FamilySvgTreeView.tsx`**
   - Removed `onWheel` prop from TreeCanvas component

## Technical Details

### Event Flow

1. **Mouse enters SVG**: `onMouseEnter` sets `mouseOverSvg = true`
2. **Wheel event occurs**: Non-passive listener captures the event
3. **Mouse position check**: Listener checks if `mouseOverSvg` is true
4. **Event processing**: If mouse is over SVG, `preventDefault()` and `handleWheel()` are called
5. **Zoom logic**: `handleWheel` processes zoom towards mouse position
6. **Mouse leaves SVG**: `onMouseLeave` sets `mouseOverSvg = false`

### Browser Compatibility

- **Modern Browsers**: Full support for non-passive event listeners
- **Mobile Devices**: `touchAction: "none"` prevents touch scroll/zoom
- **Fallback**: React's synthetic wheel events provide basic compatibility

### Performance Considerations

- **Efficient Checks**: Mouse position is checked before expensive zoom calculations
- **Event Cleanup**: Proper event listener removal prevents memory leaks
- **Minimal Re-renders**: Optimized dependency arrays in useCallback and useEffect

## Key Benefits Achieved
