# Families Feature Implementation Plan

## Overview

Add a new navigation button called "Families" that redirects to a page showing all families the current user belongs to. From there, clicking on a family redirects to a detailed page with a table of family members including pagination, search, filters, and member management actions.

## Current Project Structure Analysis

- Frontend: Next.js with TypeScript
- Backend: NestJS with Prisma
- Authentication system in place
- Existing family and member management components

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Analysis and Setup

- [x] Analyze current Navigation component structure
- [x] Review existing Dashboard component to understand family display
- [x] Examine API hooks and types for family/member data
- [x] Check existing routing structure in app directory
- [x] Review database schema for family and member relationships

### Phase 2: Create Families List Page

- [x] Create `/families` route in app/(protected)/
- [x] Create FamiliesPage component that displays user's families
- [x] Implement API call to fetch user's families
- [x] Add clickable family cards/items that navigate to family details
- [x] Style the families list page

### Phase 3: Update Navigation

- [x] Modify Navigation component to include "Families" button
- [x] Add proper routing link to `/families`
- [x] Ensure navigation works on all screen sizes

### Phase 4: Create Family Members Page

- [x] Create `/families/[familyId]/members` route
- [x] Create FamilyMembersPage component
- [x] Implement table with member information columns
- [x] Add pagination component
- [x] Add search bar functionality
- [x] Add filter options (by status, role, etc.)

### Phase 5: Member Actions Implementation

- [x] Create dropdown menu component for each member row
- [x] Implement "View" action - navigate to member details
- [x] Implement "Edit" action - open edit dialog
- [x] Implement "Add a relationship" action - open relationship dialog
- [x] Implement "Remove a relationship" action - confirmation dialog
- [x] Add "Add new member" button with dialog

### Phase 6: Backend API Integration

- [x] Ensure backend has endpoint to get user's families
- [x] Verify family members endpoint with pagination
- [x] Check member CRUD operations
- [x] Verify relationship management endpoints

### Phase 7: Testing and Refinement

- [x] Test navigation flow from dashboard to families to members
- [x] Test table functionality (pagination, search, filters)
- [x] Test all member actions
- [x] Test responsive design
- [x] Add error handling and loading states

## Technical Considerations

- Use existing UI components from shadcn/ui
- Follow current project patterns for API calls and state management
- Ensure proper TypeScript typing
- Maintain consistent styling with Tailwind CSS
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
