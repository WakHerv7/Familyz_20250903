if (sendInvitation && data.personalInfo?.email) {
  // Send invitation with selected permissions
  console.log("Sending invitation to:", data.personalInfo.email);
  console.log("With permissions:", invitationPermissions);

  toast.success(
    `Member created and invitation sent to ${data.personalInfo.email}!`
  );
} else {
  toast.success("Family member created successfully!");
}
