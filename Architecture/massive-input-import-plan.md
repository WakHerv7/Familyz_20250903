# Massive Input Import Plan - Excel & JSON File Support

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of a comprehensive bulk import system that allows users to import large amounts of family tree data from Excel (.xlsx) and JSON files. The system will support creating multiple family members and establishing complex relationships in a single operation.

## Current System Analysis
